#Using one of the comparison operators in Python, write a simple two-line program that takes the parameter n as input, which is an integer, and prints False if n is less than 100, and True if n is greater than or equal to 100.

#Don't create any if blocks (we're going to talk about them very soon). Test your code using the data we've provided for you.

n=int(input("n="))
print(n>=100)
